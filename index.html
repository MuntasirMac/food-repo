            <p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health. In fact, up to
            80% of premature heart disease and stroke can be prevented through your life choices and habits, such as eating a
            healthy diet and being physically active.</p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because
                you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have
                about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so
                different. Here it goes.</p>
